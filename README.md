## Introduction

We propose a Component-Aligned Human Motion Transfer (CAHMT) framework to decompose huge solution space and relieve appearance deviation for better pose transfer results. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst perform local part pose alignment and then conduct part-viewpoint-matched texture transformation,followed by globally-compatible human pose and appearance reﬁnement step. Extensive experimental results on both Deep Fashion and Market-1501 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

## Higher resolution results

We provide some higher resolution results (512x512) of DeepFashion dataset.

## To do

The codes and other metarils will be updated.
